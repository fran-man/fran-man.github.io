### Hello!
Hello, I'm George. I'm a software engineer and I thought it was about time to set up a small website, even if it's very simple.

I am totally new to web development (backend engineer by profession), and so even basic things like themes are a learning curve. I plan to improve on this over time!

In the short-term there are a few things I am thinking of blogging about so stay tuned - hopefully someone will find it interesting.
