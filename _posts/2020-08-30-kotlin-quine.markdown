## Introduction
For a long time now, writing a [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing\)) has been something on my programming "bucket list".
I was always intrigued by them, and thought I wanted to try writing one, but I figured it would be difficult and frustrating, so I never got round to it.

Then, the other night, I thought about it again and decided to have a go. With plenty of free time coming up over the bank holiday weekend, it was a perfect opportunity.

In this post I will quickly run through what a quine is, some of the rules, and then I will walk through in detail the steps that I took, and the thought processes that I followed (this went through a few iterations before success!)
