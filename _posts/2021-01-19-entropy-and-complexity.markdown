### Introduction
In my 9 years as a professional software engineer, I've been in many discussions, some technical, some not so technical,
that are related to eliminating or reducing complexity. I'm sure many others will have been too.

These discussions are interesting and often seem practically very useful, however, it can often seem that no matter
how much you discuss and plan to reduce complexity, and how much refactoring, simplification etc. you do, that you still
end up with an over-complicated system.

Because of this and other reasons I observed over the years, something did not sit quite right with me. It wasn't that
the never-ending crusade to eliminate complexity was useless - quite the opposite. But there was something in the way it was discussed
and conceived of that did not seem quite right.

Over the recent months, a way to articulate this has begun to form in my head to the point where I feel I can put it down in writing.
We start with a little background around my inspiration, and then move onto how this might be applied in real life.

#### Disclaimer
Some of the ideas I refer to below talk about certain concepts from Physics. I feel it necessary to make clear that I am
not a Physicist; I am a Software Engineer. I have no more than a casual interest in Science and Theoretical Physics. Therefore,
I do not claim that any of the below explanations are 100% scientifically accurate, nor do I need or want them to be. I wish to use them
as framing and motivation for a philosophical discussion, which shall follow.
